### Definition
Establishments are the central unit of enrolment within food and feed related legisation. The key fields of an establishment are its premises and its operator. A change in either of these gives rise to a different establishment. Other changes, such as changes in establishment type or the mix of activities requiring registration or approval which it undertakes, trigger a change of establishment.

### What it is not
