### Key Properties
The properties that would be shared across all implementations of this entity because they are fundamental to it. These can have a little more detail, and where possible should link out to data patterns in our data pattern library.
#### Controlled Vocabularies
The maximum permitted levels of biotoxins in shellfish are
*   PSP at 800 micrograms/kilogram of saxitoxin (STX)
*   ASP at 20 milligrams/kilogram of domoic acid (DA)

DSP is caused by a group of Lipophilic toxins and the levels are
*   OA/DTXs/ Pectenotoxins (PTXs) at 160 micrograms of Okadaic acid equivalents/kilogram
*   Yessotoxins (YTXs) at 3.75 milligram of yessotoxin equivalent/kilogram
*   Azaspiracids (AZAs) at 160 micrograms of azaspiracid equivalents/kilogram
*   DSP applicable for species not tested by LC-MS - DSP toxins must not be present

#### Contextual Properties
The properties that are most common in specific implementations of the entity, might be best to link out to subclasses if the relationship is that strong i.e. Establishment > Approved Establishment
