# Enterprise Data Model Shellfish
### Model creation date
2019-12-09
### Model last update date
2019-12-10
### Name
microbiology
### Theme
what are the key themes to this entity.
### Unique Identifiers
What are the unique identifiers and is there a system for their creation/ generation
### Definition
Classified shellfish production areas are monitored by our official control monitoring programmes. This ensures that the levels of chemical contamination in live bivalve molluscs do not exceed the regulatory limits laid down in [Commission Regulation No. 1881/2006](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32006R1881&from=EN)

Shellfish samples are collected by sampling officers and delivered to official control laboratories. At the laboratory, chemical testing is carried out to detect levels of:
*   heavy metals
*   polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)
*   dioxins if required poly-chlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) if required

### What it is not
*   biotoxin results
*   phytoplankton results

### Synonyms
*   heavy metals
*   polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)
*   dioxins if required poly-chlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) if required

### Key Properties
The properties that would be shared across all implementations of this entity because they are fundamental to it. These can have a little more detail, and where possible should link out to data patterns in our data pattern library.
#### Controlled Vocabularies
Limits for chemical contaminants

Heavy metals:
*   Lead – 1.5mg/kg
*   Cadmium – 1.0mg/kg
*   Mercury – 0.5mg/kg

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs):
*   Benzo(a)pyrene – 5.0µg/kg
*   Sum of benzo(a)pyrene, benz(a)anthracene, benzo(b)fluoranthene and chrysene – 30.0µg/kg

Dioxin and dioxin-like PCBs:
*   Sum of dioxins – 3.5pg/g wet weight
*   Sum of dioxin and dioxin-like PCBs – 6.5pg/g wet weight
*   Sum of PCB28, PCB52, PCB101, PCB138, PCB153 and PCB180 – 75ng/g wet weight

#### Contextual Properties
The properties that are most common in specific implementations of the entity, might be best to link out to subclasses if the relationship is that strong i.e. Establishment > Approved Establishment
