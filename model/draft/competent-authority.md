### Definition
A Competent Authority is defined as a body with a regulatory or supervisory role over the provision of a service, such as a professional body; for example, the Institute of Actuaries or a central or local government authority.

In broad terms, a Competent Authority is a body which regulates specific activities related to service provision, or which is responsible for authorisations and/or other formalities (registers, licences, permits, notifications), with which a business must comply in order to provide a service in scope of the Regulations.

Competent Authorities deliver food and Feed Safety official controls.  The FSA is the Central Competent Authority responsible for oversight and assurance that the food and feed regulatory system is effective.  For example, the FSA works with other Competent Authorities to ensure the Food Health Rating Scheme is delivered as it should be.
