### Definition
A Competent Authority is defined as a body with a regulatory or supervisory role over the provision of a service, such as a professional body; for example, the Institute of Actuaries or a central or local government authority.

In broad terms, a Competent Authority is a body which regulates specific activities related to service provision, or which is responsible for authorisations and/or other formalities (registers, licences, permits, notifications), with which a business must comply in order to provide a service in scope of the Regulations.

Competent Authorities deliver food and Feed Safety official controls.  The FSA is the Central Competent Authority responsible for oversight and assurance that the food and feed regulatory system is effective.  For example, the FSA works with other Competent Authorities to ensure the Food Health Rating Scheme is delivered as it should be.

### Key Properties
*   CA Reference (discussion required to determine - as needs to be used consistently across FSA Business, with a clear strategy of how to get to this point)
*   CA Official Name
*   CA Name (which name to use needs to be agreed across FSA business but could populate this field with the Official Name in the absence of anything else and then use this field)
*   CA Type (Local Authority, PHA, FSA, OGD eg DAERA/DEFRA, other partnership organisation, Primary Authority)
*   GEO area (GSS codes/polygon files for Local authorities, CEFAS data for Shellfish areas etc - this would be the ideal but may not be achievable in the short term)
*   FSA Region (England, Wales, NI)
*   Responsibility (see notes section)
*   Previous references (this field could be used to include details of historic references, may be necessary to include separate fields by relevant FSA systems)
*   notes (optional - could be used to record predecessors or other pertinent information, however this may be available via the registry)

### Notes
Start and End dates would be recorded on the registry entry and would be used to record creation and cessation of a Competent Authority and also changes to the above fields. (Is this correct?)

Responsibility - need a way to determine the remit of each CA, possible way forward could be to use a code (format to be determined, numeric used here as an example) eg
*   001 - Food Standards, no PHA required
*   002 - Food Safety
*   003 - Food Hygiene
*   004 - Feed controls
*   005 - Food Standards and Feed controls
*   006 - Food Safety, Standards, Feed Controls and Shellfish monitoring
*   007 - Shellfish monitoring
*   008 - Licencing
*   etc etc, needs work to determine precise categories, particularly where PHA required in addition

Multiple CAs may cover the same areas but not the same activities eg if a CA has a separate Port Health Authority then the respective codes for the CAs for a geographic area should cover FSA responsibilities but not duplicate

A CA can only have a single Responsibility code

Alternatively, responsibilities could be recorded individually
