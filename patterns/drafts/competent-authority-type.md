# Competent Authority Type

Version 0.x

Pattern Created: 16/01/2020

A Competent Authority is defined as a body with a regulatory or supervisory role over the provision of a service, such as a professional body; for example, the Institute of Actuaries or a central or local government authority.

Competent Authorities deliver food and Feed official controls.  The Food Standards Agency is the Central Competent Authority responsible for oversight and assurance that the food and feed regulatory system is effective.  For example, the FSA works with other Competent Authorities to ensure the Food Health Rating Scheme is delivered as it should be.

Competent authorities are in the main local government bodies but could also be other government departments (eg DEFRA, DAERA), other partnership organisations or Primary Authorities.

The Competent Authority Type will indicate the type of organisation eg Disrict Council, Partnership Organisation, Port Health Authority, Metropolitan Borough Council.
