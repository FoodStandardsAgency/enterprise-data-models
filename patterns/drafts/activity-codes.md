# Activity Codes

## Description
The activity code identifies an activity carried out by one or more of the following;

-   The FSA or another competent authority
-   Awarding body for scheme or activity
-   Food business operator
-   Establishment

### Data type and pattern
When working with activity codes in the FSA our preferred pattern to split the Activity code in to two separate fields;
1. A numeric field of two digits in the format `00`, this is the number associated with activity type
2. A numeric field of three digits in the format `000`, this is the number associated with a activity within the activity type.

## Reference data

#### Notes
The reference number found in the Activity Code will be a five digit code that comprises of the two components listed above.  This pattern outlines how the activity codes are created.  There is no need for users to manually amalgamate the two reference numbers once the Activity Code has been created.
