# Difference between a Pattern and an Enterprise Data Models

## What is a Pattern
*   A pattern is a repeatable template for a data component
    *   A data component is usually a field but can span across multiple fields i.e. Address

## What is an Enterprise Data Model
*   An enterprise data model captures the fundamental properties of a business entity and tries to harmonise the definition of that entity across services and the business

Should the thing in question not fit one of these definitions it should not be in the Enterprise Data Model repository
