Intervention is part of a `scheme`. It represents the actions available to the `Competent Authorities` who own or run the scheme. Often, the available interventions under the scope of a scheme will be laid out in the legislation or policy documentation.

An Intervention can happen to an `establishment`, `premises`, `operator` or a `person` depending on the specific intervention action.

## Unique Identifiers
Where possible, lists of interactions should be modelled as registers within the scope of a scheme and a code list created. The unique identifier should be the URI of the registry entry.

## What it is not
