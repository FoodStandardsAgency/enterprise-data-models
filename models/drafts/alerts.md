### Description
Alerts are the formal process for official communications and approved actions as a result from a food or feed incident.  This can take one of three forms:

*   Allergen Alerts (AA) - informing consumers that a food item could contain ingredients that are not listed on the allergen label.
*   Product recall information notice (PRIN) - such as a product recall for businesses, and consumers to check a product and not to consume if it falls within certain parameters.
*   Food Alert for Action (FAFA) - where a competent authority has the powers to seize described items or carry out a prescribed action.
