### Model created
10/02/2020
## Description
Enforcement is the term for the available actions to a `Competent Authority` to make establishments obey food or feed law, regulations, or policy which falls within a `scheme`.

some examples include making the establishment change the way they operate in order to comply or removing the ability for the establishment to carry out activities until the changes are made.  This can also take the form of litigation, removal of services, suspension of licensing and fines.

### Related entities
Enforcement is part of a `scheme`. It represents the actions available to the `Competent Authorities` who own or run the scheme. Often, the available enforcement actions under the scope of a scheme will be laid out in the legislation or policy documentation.

Enforcement can happen to an `establishment`, `premises`, `operator` or an person depending on the specific enforcement action.

Enforcement action is often the result of unsuccessful `interventions`, but not always.

## Unique Identifiers
Where possible, lists of enforcements should be modelled as registers within the scope of a scheme and a code list created. The unique identifier should be the URI of the registry entry.

## What it is not
An enforcement is not an `intervention` although like an `intervention` it forms part of the regulation of a scheme.  Neither is it an `activity`, but all are associated with a `scheme`.
