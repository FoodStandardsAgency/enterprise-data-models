### Definition
A Competent Authority is defined as a body with a regulatory or supervisory role over the provision of a service, such as a professional body; for example, the Institute of Actuaries or a central or local government authority.

Competent Authorities deliver food and Feed official controls.  The FSA is the Central Competent Authority responsible for oversight and assurance that the food and feed regulatory system is effective.  For example, the FSA works with other Competent Authorities to ensure the Food Health Rating Scheme is delivered as it should be.

### Key Properties

*   CA Official Name
*   CA Name (DN which name to use needs to be agreed across FSA business but could populate this field with the Official Name in the absence of anything else and then use this field - this would be the 'label' on the register)
*   CA Type (DN - to be covered under data pattern for CA Type - Local Authority, PHA, FSA, OGD eg DAERA/DEFRA, other partnership organisation, Primary Authority)
*   GEO area (DN GSS codes/polygon files for Local authorities, CEFAS data for Shellfish areas etc - this would be the ideal but may not be achievable in the short term)
