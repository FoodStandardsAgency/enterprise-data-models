##### Model created
2020-01-07

### Description
Food assurance schemes help to provide, competent authorities, consumers, and businesses with guarantees that participants adhere to particular standards.   The Food Standards Agency (FSA) maintains close contact with assurance schemes because of their potential to promote practices that contribute to recommended policy.

## Key Properties
*   Unique Identifier (UID) that identifies the establishment being enrolled for the scheme. Enrolments are concurrent and consecutive.  They have a start and end date and cannot be modified. If an establishment is removed from a scheme the status will be changed appropriately and an end date will be recorded.  Establishments can request to re-enroll provided they meet the criteria.  New enrollment documentation will be required and a new UID will be generated.  
*   Identify to person, business and establishment.
*   Records the scheme(s) being enrolled into
*   Links to the appropriate official controls.
