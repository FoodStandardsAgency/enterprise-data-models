## Description
In the context of the Food Standards Agency there are two main types of activity;

*   Regulatory activities that are carried out to legislate and regulate the food and feed sector from farm to fork.

Some regulatory activities will be Entities in their own right.  For example although Inspections may appear as an activity we also need to know more about the inspection model. For instance who carried out the inspection, where did it take place, when was it, what was being inspected, what were the results of the inspection, was any further action requited.

Other examples of Entities that could be considered as Activities include
*   timesheets
*   food and feed

## Further Information

Enrolments in activities are concurrent and consecutive.  They have a start and end date and cannot be modified. If an establishment is removed from or no longer wishes to carry out a registered business activity, the status will be changed appropriately and an end date will be recorded.  Establishments can request to re-enroll provided they meet the criteria.  New enrollment documentation will be required and a new UID will be generated.  

An example of an activity; A slaughter house would require approvals to slaughter different types of animals.  If that slaughter house then wanted to process the carcasses they would require approval to carry out cutting activity, and if they wanted to have in house cold storage they would require further approval to carry out those activities too.

Examples of Enrolment for official controls include;
*   Approvals including, slaughter, cutting, storage of food produce
*   Registrations
*   Register a Food Business (RaFB)
*   Shellfish Farming and Harvesting
