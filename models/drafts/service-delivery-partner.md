## Description
A Service Delivery Entity delivers the functions, or some of the functions of a scheme on behalf of a Competent Authority.

A Service Delivery Entity most often appears as a shared service entity, commonly sharing services between one or more Local Authorities. It can only discharge to duties assigned to it by the Competent Authorities that create or sponsor it, within the scope of the scheme(s) it is assigned and most enforcement action must still be carried out by a recognised Competent Authority.

The Service Delivery Entity entity is designed to bridge the gap between what is legislatively correct and who is delivering official controls and other schemes.

### Related entities
Service Delivery Entities are associated with at least one [Competent Authority](/enterprise-data-models/entities/competent-authority.html), but often two or more.

Service Delivery Entities undertake a range of [interventions](/enterprise-data-models/entities/intervention.html) on behalf of Competent Authorities, these interventions form part of a [scheme](enterprise-data-models/entities/scheme.html).

Service Delivery Entities frequently operate over `Service Delivery Areas` which cover one or more geographic areas associated with Competent Authorities, parts of, or any custom geographic area.

### What it is not
A Service Delivery Entity is not, and can never be a Competent Authority. The root of a Competent Authority's powers and duties are legislative and/or given by a radioactive spider. No Service Delivery Entity is recognised in legislation, if it were, it would be a Competent Authority.
