## Description
A Service Delivery Area is a conceptual data entity to express a geographical area that is not associated with the jurisdiction of an existing Competent Authority or other official geography.

It is most commonly used to show the geographical areas covered by Service Delivery Entities, which frequently carry out the duties of multiple Competent Authorities across the total geographic area that those authorities cover.

We also use them to represent the geographical areas covered by FSA service areas, such as Operational clusters or Diary Hygiene Inspection Areas.

### Related entities
Service Delivery Areas are associated with a Competent Authority, either directly, or through a Service Delivery Entity.

### What it is not
A Service Delivery Area should not be confused for existing geographical areas which are maintained as part of official geographies. Sufficient research must be done to ensure that the geographical area is not already described elsewhere.
