# Entity Templating
We template entities consistently, but not all entities use all of the templated properties.

###  Last updated, version and status
Our models always starts with the date they were last updated and the version number. Stable entities are numbered incrementally from 1.0, and experimental models incrementally from 0.0. For changes to published models, and a major revision means we've split or merged models to create new distinct entities. We will link out to new models when this happens.

> This entity was last updated on **01/01/2020**. This is version **1.0**

We then indicate whether the entity is experimental or stable. Sometimes an entity needs a lot of drafting and discussion before we nail it down, and we would like to do that in the open to encourage collaboration.

We use the following labels to indicate the status of a model.

Experimental
{: .label .label-yellow }

or

Stable
{: .label .label-green }
