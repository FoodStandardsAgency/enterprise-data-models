# enterprise-data-models

This Repository contains all of the entity models used within the Food Standards agency. The creation of these models is an ongoing and evolutionary process so this repository does not contain a model for every entity used within the FSA. An explanation of what is contained within an entity model can be found here: [EntityModel.md](/EntityModel.md).

### instructions
please see the below files for instructions on how to:
##### [Create an entity model](/HowToCreateAnEntityModel.md)
##### [Update an entity model](/UpdatingAnExistingModel.md)
##### [Retire an entity model](/RetireAnExistingModel.md)

A list of planned entity models that have not yet been started can be found here:
##### [Planned entity models](/PlannedEntityModels.md)

Pull requests and issues from both inside and outside of the FSA are welcomed.
