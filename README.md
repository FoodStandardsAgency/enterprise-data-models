# enterprise-data-models

This Repository contains all of the entity models used within the Food Standards agency. The creation of these models is an ongoing and evolutionary process so this repository does not contain a model for every entity used within the FSA. An explanation of what is contained within an entity model can be found here: [EntityModel.md](/EntityModel.md).

### Creating an entity model
When creating an entity model the markdown file should be stored in the /model/draft folder. The file should be named after the entity being described i.e. establishment.md should a file already exist with the same name in /model/current then a different name should be used for both the entity and the file. Please create a copy of [template.md](/model/template.md) when creating the file. any models that have been accepted for use should be added to /model/current via a pull request. This request must be approved by a member of the FSA data team before being merged.

Pull requests and issues from both inside and outside of the FSA are welcomed.
