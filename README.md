# FSA data Entities and Patterns

This Repository contains the enterprise data models and data patterns designed by the Data Team for use by anyone in the Agency (or outside if you like :+1:)

We've also turned it into a [GitHub pages site](https://foodstandardsagency.github.io/enterprise-data-models/) to make it easier to browse.

### Data Entities

Data entities are a conceptual model of a business concept within the scope of FSA business. They define what the entity is and means within the scope of the business, as well as explaining what the key properties of that entity are. Key properties of an entity do not include all of an entities' properties, just those whose absence would make the entity inoperable.

The creation of these models is an ongoing and evolutionary process so this repository does not contain a model for every entity used within the FSA.

You are welcome to take a look at our [template for our entity models](/EntityModel.md).

### Data Patterns

Data patterns are the smallest unit of best practice in the data design system. They are repeatable patterns for data elements which often work at the field level or across multiple fields for elements that work better in that way.

Some of the patterns are industry recognised best practices, put into context for the FSA, some are FSA specific and some are cross-government or cross-sector and are our view of working with those data elements within our domain.

Everyone who works on services for the FSA should be aware of the data patterns and use them. By doing this we begin to converge new and legacy services on established patterns which helps to reduce development time and increases data interoperability.

### Instructions
please see the below files for instructions on how to:
##### [Create an entity model](/HowToCreateAnEntityModel.md)
##### [Update an entity model](/UpdatingAnExistingModel.md)
##### [Retire an entity model](/RetireAnExistingModel.md)

A list of planned entity models that have not yet been started can be found here:
##### [Planned entity models](/PlannedEntityModels.md)

Pull requests and issues from both inside and outside of the FSA are welcomed.
